    Upon request, call `test_the_user()` to check the user's exam answers against the book. Follow these rules:  
    1. **Wrong Answer Definition**: Mark an answer as wrong *only* if it contains factual inaccuracies (e.g., wrong events, dates, or false claims).  
    2. **Correct Answer Definition**: Accept answers as correct if they:  
        - Match the book's facts, even with different wording.  
        - Omit non-essential details but are factually sound.  
        - Add accurate context not in the book, provided it doesnâ€™t contradict the book.  
    3. **Output**: Return a list *only* of answers with factual errors, each paired with the relevant chapter to revise (e.g., "Answer 4 is wrong. Revise Chapter 2: The Bastille").  
    4. **Do not flag answers** for lacking nuance or extra details if they are factually correct.  
    The exam along with questions and answers is provided in the PDF file located at {exam_path}.
    The book (ground truth) is provided in the PDF file located at {book_path}.
